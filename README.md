# MyClimate

## About The Application

MyClimate is a super simple weather app that is compatible with dark mode! It uses the OpenWeatherMap API and supports getting the weather from your current GPS location. If you're like me and don't need all the extra clutter aside from the current weather outside, MyClimate is for you.
